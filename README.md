A versatile Python library for electronics engineers, students, and hobbyists to perform circuit analysis, simulations, and complex electronics calculations with ease.

## 🚀 About The Project

**NodeLab** is an electronics simulation and calculation toolkit for Python. It's designed to be an academic and professional tool, allowing students and engineers to solve circuit problems, analyze parameters, and test designs directly in a Python environment.

Instead of relying on separate calculator tools, you can now integrate circuit analysis (like nodal analysis), component calculations, and engineering standards directly into your scripts.

### Key Features

* **Circuit Analysis:** Core functions for solving circuit parameters, inspired by concepts like Nodal Analysis.
* **Component Calculations:** Handle resistor color codes, parallel/series resistance, capacitor values, etc.
* **Engineering Standards:** Includes utilities for common standards, such as calculating creepage and clearance distances (e.g., IPC-2221, IEC-60950).
* **Educational Focus:** Built with clear, accessible functions to assist both students learning and teachers demonstrating electronics concepts.

## 📦 Installation

Install `NodeLab` easily using pip:

```bash
